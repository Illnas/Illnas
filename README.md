#Welcome to my Github Profile

Hey. I am Dario Å½alac (also known as "Nadatari").

I am a guy who stumbled upon Web Design as a student that just had to quit from his university life 
cause my family had financial troubles. Years later, and as 27-year-old, you will notice one thing; I am not giving
up on Web Design! I might have to take pause and focus on something else (jobs, other courses, etc, etc) but
I will not give up on Web Design. At this moment, I am probably slamming my head on table wondering where did 
I mess up, but don't worry! I will find solution! I always find solution! 

Anyway, I do hope that You, as a HR personel, won't focus too much on what I type here, but more on projects I 
have done. I kinda find expressing what I learned and what I need to learn after I finish my projects kinda helpful,
afterall, I am not working in proffessional environment so I don't have anyone with experience to rely on, or ask for 
advices.




Btw, Illnas is one of those nicknames almost everyone made when Legion (WoW Expansion) came, and we all
wanted to be baddas Demon Hunters. I do regret it tho!
