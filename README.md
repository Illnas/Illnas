# Hey! I am Dario Å½alac and welcome to my Github Profile!


I am a guy who started programming as hobby during his student days. And after all those struggles, you will notice that years later, I did not give up on programming! Sometimes I take break, but I always come back. At this moment, I am probably slamming my head on table wondering where did 
I mess up, what did I mess up, how did I mess up... But don't worry! I always find solution! 

Anyway, you are probably wondering what I do, so I will give you a small list of things I code with: </br>

Btw, Illnas is one of those nicknames almost everyone made when Legion (WoW Expansion) came, and we all
wanted to be baddas Demon Hunters. I do regret it tho!
